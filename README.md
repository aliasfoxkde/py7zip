# py7zip
An unofficial, cross platform, lightweight and easy to use port of 7zip command line binaries (7za) for Python. Unlike other libraries, this one fully supports 7zip natively, is easy to setup/install, and is "pythonic" with the intent to be used in code and scripts, not through the terminal.
